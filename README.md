HiðŸ‘‹ I'm Lucas Semelin! I'm a product engineer & consultant, specialized design, development and implementation of SaaS and web applications.

## About Me

------------

I've been working with web development for fifteen years, and started to work in UX/UI project five years ago, when I understand that every digital product is a combination of a great user experience and a strong technological platform. Since then, I help businesses and government in every single step of their digital products, from conception to implementation and evolution.
